        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>My favorite part about the web development process is coding! It's so interesting to me that I can use computer languages to make awesome designs and develop logic for programs. It also improves my problem-solving skills. Overall, I find
          coding fun and challenging.</p>

        <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p class="no-margin">Artificial intelligence is probably the area of computer science that interests me most. The subject has existed since 1956, and yet it just recently started kicking off at a fast pace. Although I'm a web developer, I'd definitely like to look into AI more. I've even started reading a new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Beginners-Understanding-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B0829G6FJ3/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=machine+learning+for+beginners&qid=1581212434&sr=8-9" target="_blank">book about AI</a> that I recommend to anyone wanting to know more about the field.</p>

        <h3>Video Games</h3>
        <p>I also love playing video games. I don't have a specific genre of games I prefer, and I mostly play on PS4. My favorite game is <a href="https://godofwar.playstation.com/" target="_blank">God of War</a>. Most of the time, however, I get on PS4 to just talk to friends and family in a party.</p>
